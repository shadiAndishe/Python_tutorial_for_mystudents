# Python Study Guide Repository

Welcome to the Python Study Guide! My name is Shadi, and I’m an AI and Computer Vision developer. I’m excited to share this guide with you, especially as I work to teach Python to students in my country through voluntary efforts. This repository is a collection of resources designed to help you learn Python step by step. Whether you’re new to programming or already familiar with some concepts, this guide will walk you through a range of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and algorithm analysis.

Throughout the guide, we will cover a wide range of subjects with examples and exercises to help you apply what you've learned. You'll get to work with real-world examples that deepen your understanding and improve your programming skills. Here’s an overview of the topics you’ll explore:

1. **The Way of the Program** – An introduction to programming concepts.
2. **Variables, Expressions, and Statements** – Learn how to handle data and control flow.
3. **Functions** – Dive into function definitions, usage, and recursion.
4. **Interface Design & Case Studies** – Practical implementation with Python’s turtle module and more.
5. **Conditionals & Recursion** – Making decisions and understanding recursion.
6. **Fruitful Functions** – Using return values and advancing through more complex functions.
7. **Iteration** – Working with loops and algorithms.
8. **Strings & Lists** – Manipulating data in sequences like strings and lists.
9. **Dictionaries & Tuples** – Unlock the power of Python’s built-in data structures.
10. **File Handling** – Learn how to read, write, and manage files.
11. **Classes & Objects** – Master object-oriented programming with Python.
12. **Inheritance & Polymorphism** – Dive deeper into the powerful concepts of inheritance and method overriding.

The goal of this repository is to help you build a strong foundation in Python, with a particular focus on its practical applications in AI and computer vision. As we work through the chapters, you’ll develop the skills needed to write clean, efficient code and understand complex algorithms.

Feel free to explore the chapters, experiment with the examples, and reach out if you have any questions. I’m excited to help you on your Python learning journey. Let’s get started!
